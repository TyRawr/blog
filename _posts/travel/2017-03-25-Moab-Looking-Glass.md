## For Ciera and I's first anniversary we went to Moab Utah!

We decided that an easy multipitch climb would be a very fun thing to do. 
Neither of us had done a multipitch climb, and we're pumped to finally do one!

We wanted to get the most out of our short time in Moab. So, we decided that going first thing in the morning would be the best.
And it turned out to be a great idea.

*This is what the Looking Glass rock looks like from where you can park/camp*

You get to the route by going around the whole dome. Which is great to see the whole geometry, as you walk around.

The guide informed us that where the climb starts - there is a winter nest/cave where rattle snakes live. There can be hundreds of rattle snakes in that area. Eek.

*We were fortunate enough to not be delayed/deterred by rattle snakes. We didn't see ANY rattle snakes. But we did see this lizard!*

There was a medium sized group (6 people?) using the route as we got there. 
They were all apart of a church group and were all quite nice people.

We saw what looked to be a few groups of climbers heading to the route as we were leaving.

So, getting there in the early morning was a good idea.
